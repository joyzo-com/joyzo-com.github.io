        <h3>Statistics</h3>
        <p>The website uses a minimal build of Google Analytics, a service which transmits website traffic data to
          Google servers in the United States and allows us to notice trends to improve the user experience on our
          website. This minimal build processes personal data such as: the unique User ID set by Google Analytics, the
          date and time, the title of the page being viewed, the URL of the page being viewed, the URL of the page that
          was viewed prior to the current page, the screen resolution, the time in local timezone, the files that were
          clicked on and downloaded, the links clicked on to an outside domain, the type of device, and the country,
          region, and city.
        </p>
        <p>You may opt out of this tracking at any time by activating the “Do Not Track” setting in your browser.

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Embedded Content</h3>
        <p>Pages on the Website may include embedded content (e.g. videos, charts, etc.). Embedded content from other
          websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor had visited the other website. These websites may
          collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with
          that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and
          are logged in to that website.
